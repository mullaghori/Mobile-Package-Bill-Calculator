# Mobile-Package-Bill-Calculator

It's a practice project for python beginners.

A mobile phone service provider has three different subscription packages for its customers:
```
Package 1   _For RM40 per month 450 minutes are provided.
            _Additional minutes are RM0.45 per minute. 
Package 2   _For RM60 per month 900 minutes are provided.
            _Additional minutes are RM0.45 per minute.
Package 3   _For RM70 per month unlimited minutes are provided. 
```

***ðŸ‘‰ No.1 Design a program that calculates a customer's monthly bill. It should ask which package the customer has purchased and how many minutes were used. It should then display the total amounts due.***
