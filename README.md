# Mobile Package Bill Calculator

It's a practice project for python beginners.

A mobile phone service provider has three different subscription packages for its customers:
```
Package 1   - For RM40 per month 450 minutes are provided.
            - Additional minutes are RM0.45 per minute. 
Package 2   - For RM60 per month 900 minutes are provided.
            - Additional minutes are RM0.45 per minute.
Package 3   - For RM70 per month unlimited minutes are provided.
